      <b>Abstract</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      We present a study of one-dimensional planar detonations in
      white dwarf material at varying compositions of C, O, and Ne,
      motivated by recent stellar evolution models which predict
      hybrid white dwarf stars with a C, O core inside an O, Ne
      shell. At a given density and composition, we integrate the
      Zel'dovich, von Neumann, During (ZND) equations while varying
      the strength of support for overdriven detonations to determine
      the detonation velocity corresponding to the sonic point. The
      pressure, density, and composition structure in the region
      behind the shock front for a barely overdriven detonation then
      characterizes steady-state burning and provides time scales
      that can be used to calibrate a combustion model for use in
      simulations of thermonuclear supernovae. This calibration will
      enable a future study of hybrid C, O, Ne white dwarf stars as
      possible progenitors for some Type Ia supernovae.
