      <b>Abstract</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Motivated by recent results in stellar evolution in which
      convective boundary mixing in SAGB stars can give rise to
      hybrid white dwarf (WD) stars with a C-O core inside an O-Ne
      shell, we simulate thermonuclear (Type Ia) supernovae from
      these hybrid progenitors. We use the FLASH code to perform
      multidimensional simulations in the deflagration to
      detonation transition (DDT) explosion paradigm from
      progenitor models produced with the MESA stellar evolution
      code that include the thermal energetics of the Urca
      process. We performed a suite of DDT simulations over a
      range of ignition conditions and compare to previous results
      from a suite of C-O white dwarfs. Despite significant
      variability within each suite, distinguishing trends are
      apparent in their Ni-56 yields and the kinetic properties of
      their ejecta. We comment on the feasibility of these hybrid
      WD explosions as the source of some classes of observed
      subluminous events.
