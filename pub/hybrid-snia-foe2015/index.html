      Motivated by recent results in stellar evolution predicting hybrid
      white dwarf (WD) stars with a C, O core inside an O, Ne shell, we
      simulate thermonuclear (Type Ia) supernovae from these hybrids using a
      multidimensional deflagration to detonation transition (DDT) paradigm
      implemented in the FLASH code. Using a hybrid WD model including the
      effects of the Urca process produced by the stellar evolution code
      MESA, we map the progenitor to the FLASH grid preserving hydrostatic
      equilibrium. We then perform a suite of DDT simulations over a range
      of ignition conditions consistent with the progenitor's thermal and
      convective structure. To compare Type Ia supernovae from these hybrid
      WD stars to previous results for C, O white dwarfs, we construct a set
      of C, O WD models and simulate their explosions as Type Ia supernovae
      using randomized ignition conditions but the same central density and
      DDT density as the hybrid progenitor. We find that despite the
      individual variability within the suites of hybrid models and C, O
      models, trends distinguishing their Type Ia supernovae are apparent in
      their Ni-56 yields and the kinetic properties of their ejecta, leading
      us to suggest observational signatures of the hybrid C, O, Ne white
      dwarfs.
