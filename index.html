  Welcome! I'm Donald Willcox and I'm a graduate research assistant in
  computational nuclear astrophysics at Stony Brook University working with
  <a href="http://www.astro.sunysb.edu/acalder/">Prof. Alan Calder</a>.
  My current research interests include simulations of
  Type Ia Supernovae from novel progenitor systems and
  multidimensional reactive-hydrodynamic studies of the Urca process
  in Type Ia progenitors.
